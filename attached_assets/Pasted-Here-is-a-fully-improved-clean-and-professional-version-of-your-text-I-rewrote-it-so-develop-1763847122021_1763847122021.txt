Here is a **fully improved, clean, and professional version** of your text.
I rewrote it so developers can understand exactly what features you want for **Add Post** across all categories.

# ✅ **Improved Version (Clear & Professional)**

Please add the following feature enhancements to the **Add Post** section:

### **1. “Nearby” field for property**

When posting a **villa** or **land**, include a “Nearby” section where users can list nearby places or landmarks (e.g., schools, supermarkets, hospitals).

### **2. Electronics Category Improvements**

For **Electronics**, include sub-options:

* iPhone
* Samsung
* Other models

Each phone post should allow adding:

* Battery health

* Storage size
* Condition

Then show relevant fields depending on the choice.

### **6. Photo Upload Limit**

Every post should allow **up to 4 images maximum**.

### **7. Location System**

Users must be able to add location in two ways:

When choosing from Google Maps, show the map and allow pin placement.

### **8. Search Filters**
